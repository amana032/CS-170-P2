# CS-170-Project 2

Machine Learning is a subfield of  artificial intelligence in which computers are designed to “learn” from data, enabling them to better understand and recognize patterns in the information over time through self-direction. By analyzing data iteratively over time, the system is able to increase its accuracy and efficiency.

This is my solution to Dr. Eamonn Keogh’s Project 2 under CS170: Introduction to AI at the University of California, Riverside, Winter 2025. The goal of the project is to build a Machine Learning classification system, using the nearest neighbor algorithm as our classifier and leave-one-out cross-validation as a measure of accuracy, to find the most significant features of a dataset using the Forward Selection and Backward Elimination techniques. These features are then the model by which the system will continue to classify new data entries. 

To test our solution, we are provided a personal small and large dataset. The solution program created is written in Python 3.11.9. This report describes implemented algorithms, tracebacks, and contains the code of the project itself, which is written to accept any number of features for any number of potential classes, although the small and large datasets tested are two-class problems.
